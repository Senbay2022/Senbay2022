# ðŸŽ™ How to setup

### Metamask Setup

{% hint style="info" %}
Metamask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications
{% endhint %}

You will need to [download Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html) and install it on your preferred browser. Then you'll need to create a **MetaMask** account.

_Remember to keep you password and Secret Backup Phrase safe._

### Polygon Setup

> Polygon is an Ethereum layer-2 protocol and framework for building interconnected blockchain ecosystems, launched in 2017. Polygon maintains the **$MATIC** ticker for its native utility token.

You'll need to connect your **MetaMask** account to the **Polygon** blockchain

To connect to the Polygon network you can follow the following article:&#x20;

Your Network configuration should look similar to the following:

### $MATIC

Before playing, you will also need to ensure that you have some $MATIC to fund your Fish.

You can buy **MATIC** tokens on a range of open exchanges. To use on the Polygon network, you will first need to transfer these tokens from the exchange (eg. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en)) onto the Polygon network. The easiest way to achieve this is through Binance's recent [**Polygon Wallet Integration**](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/4515e97c82d64189885da7cd7d606b86). Now you can directly withdraw to your Polygon address that was created above during MetaMask/Polygon setup. You can find this by going into the Withdraw section of **Binance**. Input your Address, select the network (MATIC) and the desired amount. WIthin a couple of minutes you'll be able to see the amount sent on your MetaMask account.

### Mining fees

Since the game is powered by blockchain technologies we must pay miners a _**small fee**_ each time that we want to save our Easy zone to the blockchain. This fee ensures that our Farming zone is **safe, secure and reliable.** Saving a Easy zone to the blockchain depends on the current gas price of the network. When Polygon is busy, the price increases. When it is quiet, it lessens.
