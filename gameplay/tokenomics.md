# ðŸ’° Tokenomics

### CONTRACT ADDRESS

Coming Soon

## Halving system

To make the economy of the game last, it is necessary to make adaptations according to the number of coins in circulation. For this we have taken over the system of the Sunflower-farmers game and will reduce the winnings related to Super.



{% hint style="info" %}
The earlier you start Super, the more you will be rewarded as when the supply increases. the number of tokens in rewards where will be. The below table examines the rewards for collecting stones. When the supply is less than 100, 000 $SFG farmers receive **$0.01** when they collect a stone. On the other hand, when supply is between 100, 000 and 500, 000 $DMT miners will only receive **$0.002** when they collect the same stone.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
A sudden increase in miners would drive the supply high and could quickly change the rewards you receive per mineral. It is advised to pay attention to the current supply and mine mineral that can be harvested before the next halving window.
{% endhint %}

### Linear Growth after 1, 000, 000, 000

The more tokens that are generated, the harder they are to fish. In decades to come, when the token supply reaches 1 Trillion there will be no more 'halvening' periods. Instead the tokenomics will become linear and extremely scarce.
