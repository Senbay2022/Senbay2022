# ðŸ‘¨ðŸš’ FAIR WARNING

Investing in cryptocurrency games, coins and tokens including $FLT can **be very risky.**\
Cryptocurrency investments are often speculative and do not guarantee profit so invest with caution.\
\
Some people create a token and then remove the liquidity from the liquidity pool after other people buy the token with no intention to return it.\
This is known as a 'rug' or 'rug pull' and leaves traders stuck with token they can not sell unless someone else adds liquidity.\
The creators often do this under false premise and are essentially stealing everybody else's money.\
This is why many meme coins like **FLT have liquidity pools locked for period of time.**\
\
Fishland project features are exposed and available to the public with direct links on this website.\
Never send your private keys or seed phrase to anyone and never use it to log into a site or app.\
Furthermore, please ensure you are not violating the laws of your territory when buying $FLT.
